# @pivi/obsidian-host package guide

*This file extends the root [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md). Follow root guidance first, then these package-specific rules.*

## Purpose

`@pivi/obsidian-host` is the Obsidian/Electron host adapter layer. It wraps vault APIs, file stores, settings persistence, shared storage, secret storage, host context, path normalization, and renderer compatibility helpers.

This package translates platform capabilities into host-neutral ports. App composition, not the engine or UI, connects those adapters to product behavior.

## Public entrypoints

- `src/index.ts` re-exports the package surface. Add new intentional host APIs here.
- `src/obsidianVaultApi.ts` wraps Obsidian `App` vault operations: note reads/writes/edits, file resolution, tree/list, move/trash/folder creation, open-in-leaf, scan-based search scoped to a note or folder, note info, links, backlinks, tag/graph analysis, base-file/view inspection, recent files, attachment metadata, and binary attachment creation with Obsidian markdown links. Base lookup uses direct path/metadata resolution, and unresolved-only graph analysis reads metadata without enumerating files. Mutating paths use `requireAgentVaultMutationPath` (containment + managed-namespace policy); delete/move-source/mkdir use recursive mode so ancestors of managed roots are rejected. Before editing, overwriting, appending, prepending, changing properties, moving, deleting, or restoring an existing `.md` / `.canvas`, the API requires `fileRecoverySnapshot.ts` to complete. Folder move/delete recursively snapshots all supported descendants before host mutation; any failure aborts the whole operation. New paths and unsupported attachments need no File Recovery snapshot; attachment deletion still uses Obsidian trash.
- `src/vaultEditMatch.ts` owns exact occurrence counting, replacement, ambiguity errors, and straight-versus-curly quote mismatch diagnostics used by `ObsidianVaultApi.editNote`.
- `src/fileRecoverySnapshot.ts` resolves the enabled `file-recovery` internal plugin and calls private `forceAdd(path, content)` for `.md` / `.canvas` files before Pivi vault mutations. Disabled/unavailable File Recovery, a missing private API, and capture failure are explicit blocking errors.
- `src/externalFileApi.ts` wraps Node.js `fs` for reading and listing files outside the Obsidian vault by absolute path. It enforces allowed-directory realpath containment and is the host-neutral filesystem adapter consumed by external read/list tools.
- File-store contracts now live in `@pivi/agent/ports`; this package implements host adapters for those ports.
- Domain service contracts live with their owning `@pivi/agent` modules; app workspace initialization remains an app-composition contract.
- `src/bootstrap/` defines host context, app storage, and tab manager state contracts.
- `src/storage/` implements vault file, home file, and shared app storage adapters. Product settings normalization is injected by the app composition layer. Deleted chats are not stored in plugin `data.json`; leftover `deletedSessionFiles` marks are consumed once so callers can relocate JSONL into `.pivi/trash/sessions/`.
- `src/settings/` owns vault settings persistence and the codec contract used to inject product/runtime normalization plus an optional pre-save projection. Product defaults live in `@pivi/agent/settings` and `@pivi/agent/runtime`; Pi-specific normalization and device-local-field stripping live outside this package. App composition injects `createPiviSettingsCodec`, which may commit device-local provider and environment state in `prepareForSave` before writing stripped `PersistedPiviSettings` (`VaultPersistedPiviSettings`); `SharedStorageService.savePiviSettings` surfaces synced write failures with a localized Notice while preserving committed local authority. Settings load/save use `@pivi/agent/config/publication` for corrupt-source preservation (`.corrupt-*` artifacts), parse diagnostics, serialized per-path saves, and atomic replacement when the file store supports rename. Runtime load still uses the full `PiviSettings` bag (`StoredPiviSettings`).
- `src/path/` owns filesystem/vault path normalization and safety helpers. `normalizePathForVault` remains the read/display helper and may return an external/absolute path when input is outside the vault. Mutating vault operations must call `requireVaultRelativeMutationPath`, which fails loudly on empty paths, absolute/drive/UNC forms, traversal, NUL, and symlink-parent escape (using nearest-existing-ancestor realpath containment). Agent-facing vault mutations use `requireAgentVaultMutationPath` (containment then managed-namespace policy): after canonicalization it rejects exact/descendant targets under Pivi-managed MCP (`.pivi/mcp.json` + temp/backup/corrupt siblings, `.pivi/mcp-oauth/**`), Skills (`.pivi/skills/**`, staging/CLI metadata and `skills-<operation>-*` transaction roots including remove), and Commands (`.pivi/commands/**`, `.pivi/templates/**`), with `mode: 'recursive'` also blocking ancestors for delete/move-source/mkdir. Errors name the owning `pivi_mcp` / `pivi_skills` / `pivi_commands` tool. Unrelated `.pivi/*` paths stay allowed. Policy does not cover Bash/eval or manual user filesystem edits; Settings/coordinators persist via FileStore, not `ObsidianVaultApi` mutation methods.
- `src/authContextHost.ts` adapts the canonical auth context host port to system environment variables, filesystem existence checks, and home-directory lookup for Pi auth resolution.
- `src/secrets/` re-exports the canonical provider secret-storage surface (the implementation lives in `@pivi/agent/auth/providerSecretStorage`).
- `src/shims/` holds narrow renderer-compatibility shims activated by the build (for example `debug.ts`, a no-op replacement for the upstream `debug` module).
- `src/providerLegacyAuthStore.ts` adapts the canonical provider legacy auth store port to the vault-local `.pivi/auth.json` file used only for old Codex credential migration.
- `src/scopedHttpClient.ts` implements the streaming scoped HTTP client (deadlines, encoded/decoded byte limits, content types, redirects, DNS pin of the selected allowed address subset) over `@pivi/agent/network` policy. Each redirect hop gives socket acquisition plus TCP/TLS handshake its Connect budget, then starts a separate First-byte budget while waiting for response headers; body idle and whole-request Total budgets remain independent, and `totalMs` / `idleMs` of `0` disable those timers. `src/createPiviNetworkClients.ts` builds purpose-scoped clients (`provider`, `mcp`, `web-search`, `web-fetch`, `image`, `skills`, connectivity) and a shared `OriginGrantRegistry` for private-origin exceptions; provider fetch reads a mutable deadline object (`setProviderDeadlines`, defaults `600000`/`0`) so later requests pick up changes without recreating clients; configured MCP and custom-provider private origins receive session-lifetime grants re-issued on settings save (via `revokeByPurpose` + `grantPrivateOrigins`) and cleared on unload, while the registry also supports short-lived grants for other callers. `src/bundledFetch.ts` is esbuild-injected so free `fetch` identifiers resolve to the scoped provider client without assigning `window.fetch`. `src/nodeFetch.ts` remains a legacy export surface over scoped fetch; do not reintroduce global fetch patching. `src/obsidianHttpClient.ts` adapts scoped clients to the `HttpClient` port. `src/electronCompat.ts` and `src/systemProcessRunner.ts` cover other renderer/Electron compatibility gaps; `systemProcessRunner` is the bounded process primitive: required byte limits/timeout/cwd/shell policy, streaming truncation metadata, AbortSignal, process-tree termination with forced-kill escalation, and termination-kind results (exit/signal/timeout/abort/spawn-error/forced-kill). Shell is forbidden unless a reviewed adapter declares an explicit reason (for example Windows `.cmd`).
- `src/cli/obsidianCliTransport.ts` executes the official Obsidian CLI through the injected `ProcessRunner` with vault cwd policy rather than a private unbounded spawn. `src/cli/officialObsidianCli.ts` reads the host `obsidian.json` (`cli: true`) from macOS Application Support, Windows `%APPDATA%`, or Linux `~/.config`.
- `styles/pivi-theme.css` maps Obsidian theme variables into the `--pivi-host-*` contract consumed by `@pivi/pivi-react`; the root CSS build prepends it directly before the React style manifest. It is a build input, not a JavaScript package export.

## Boundaries

- This package may import Obsidian API types, Electron/renderer globals, and Node platform modules needed for host adaptation.
- Implement host adapters against `@pivi/agent/ports` (file stores, secrets, HTTP, process, openers). App composition injects those adapters into the Pi engine; the engine must not import this package.
- Do not import UI components or Pi engine implementation details. Expose host capabilities through typed contracts.
- Do not import `@pivi/engine-pi`, `@pivi/agent/skills`, `@pivi/agent/tools`, or concrete Obsidian tool implementations; app composition and tool packages should add product/runtime/tool semantics above the host layer.
- Keep path validation and vault containment checks here when they protect host file operations.
- Preserve explicit errors for missing vault paths, unsafe paths, storage failures, and unsupported host operations.
- Obsidian public API is preferred for vault operations; CLI is only for capabilities the public API cannot provide.

## Package map

- `package.json` exports the barrel and explicit leaf subpaths (`authContextHost`, `bootstrap/hostContext`, `bootstrap/storage`, `bootstrap/types`, `bundledFetch`, `cli/obsidianCliTransport`, `cli/officialObsidianCli`, `createPiviNetworkClients`, `electronCompat`, `externalFileApi`, `nodeFetch`, `obsidianHttpClient`, `openExternalUrl`, `path`, `providerLegacyAuthStore`, `scopedHttpClient`, `settings/piviSettingsStorage`, `storage/sharedStorageService`, `systemProcessRunner`). The canonical vault edit matcher is intentionally available through the root barrel beside `ObsidianVaultApi`. Add new intentional leaf APIs to both `src/index.ts` and the matching export entry.
- There is no package-local build step; source is consumed by the root build.
- There is no package-local typecheck script. Verify host changes with the root typecheck and targeted tests for affected tools/runtime/UI.

## Documentation

Keep durable package rationale in this file. If behavior moves or package boundaries change, update this guide instead of adding separate architecture/spec/note docs.
